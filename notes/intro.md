# Notes

## What's cool about Vue?
* Declarative
* Legible
* Easy to maintain
* Powerful
* A collection of the best of the best
* Elegant
* Gives me what I want when I need it, & gets out of my way - "Don't make me think about the wrong thing"
* Fun!
* Keeps you from Yack shaving, not having to re-implement over & over

## Comparison with other frameworks
* A virtual DOM
* Reactive components that offer the View layer only (similar to react)
* Props & a Redux-like store similar to React
* Conditional rendering, services, similar to Angular
* Inspired by Polymer for simplicity & performance, Vue offers a similar development style as HTML, styles & JS are composed in tandem
* Slightly better performance than React, no use of polyfills like Polymer

## Agenda
* Intro
* Stuff to get you going
* Exercises to help you learn
* Covering basic premises, add a couple of more advanced features (i.e. mixins)

##
* Nuxt -> build process you can use, server side rendering
