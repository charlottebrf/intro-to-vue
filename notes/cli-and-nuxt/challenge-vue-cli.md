* Refactor to set it up in Vue.cli
* If want to can set it up in Nuxt instead & use routing
* Vue PWA template vs Nuxt - both have code splitting `nuxt.config`, `index.html` are different.
* If you need server side rendering, go for Nuxt 
* When to use Nuxt? When you start using routing then you should use Nuxt, performance wins on this
